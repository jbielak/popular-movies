   # Popular Movies
   
   Android app that enables user to explore movies from The Movie Database.
   I created this application during Android Developer Nanodegree program and I improve it continuously.
   
   ## Getting Started
   
   Currently you can build the application in Android Studio and install on emulator or device.
   
   To build the app you need to provide your API key to https://www.themoviedb.org/.
   
   Create file:
   
   ```
   app/api.properties
   ```
   Put below text in api.properties and provide your API key:
   ```
   moviesDbApiKey=yourKeyHere
   ```
